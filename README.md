# SBG-Ellipse-2N-Sensor-Data-Extraction-Code
This code implements a firmware for extracting data from an SBG Ellipse-2N sensor. It configures three serial interfaces to communicate with the sensor and other devices, and reads data from the sensor to extract Euler angles, navigation data, and GPS data.
